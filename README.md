# Beer-Project-Demo - 3D integration
<p>This project is a single web page using React, ViteJs, and Tailwind. Initially conceived as a demonstration for a client, the aim was to exemplify the fusion of frontend design animations and 3D integration. The overarching concept revolved around presenting these impressive design integrations, leveraging them as a compelling asset to elevate the client's business. The user experience (UX) was harnessed as a powerful tool, allowing users to engage with the product through interactive 3D experiences.</p>
